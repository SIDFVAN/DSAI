In other words, for both women and men, the same percentage of respondents will give the same answer to the question.\n","\n","## The chi-squared test for independence\n","\n","\n","### The chi-squared distribution\n","\n","### Cramér's V\n","\n","### Goodness-of-fit test\n","\n","### standardised residuals\n","\n","## Module 5 - Bivariate analysis: qualitative vs quantitative\n","\n","In this module, we discuss the case where the independent variable is qualitative and the dependent is quantitative. Some typical examples of research question in this case:\n","\n","Within a certain species of animals, are male individuals significantly larger than females?\n","Does a new vaccine protect against the disease like it's supposed to?\n","Does a certain study method like \"retrieval practice\" actually improve learning outcomes (i.e. student's grades)?\n","In this course, we only treat the case where we compare two groups. There are methods to compare more than two groups (e.g. the ANOVA test), but those are beyond the scope of this course.\n","\n","###The t-test for two independent samples\n","\n","###The t-test for paired samples\n","\n","## Module 6. Bivariate analysis of 2 quantitative variables\n","\n","In this module, we discuss the case where both variables are quantitative. Specifically, we'll explore the concept of linear regression. Other analysis methods do exist, but those are beyond the scope of this course.\n","\n","Regression analysis is an extremely flexible tool that can aid decision making in many areas. Kimes and Fitzsimmons (1990) describe how it has been used by La Quinta Motor Inns, a moderately priced hotel chain oriented toward serving the business traveler, to help make site location decisions.\n","\n","There are two potential objectives of regression analysis. The first objective is to understand how the world operates, for example, one might try to discover whether there is any gender discrimination in salaries, taking into account differences in work experience and education level.\n","The second objective is to make predictions. A good example of this is when the variable in question is company sales, and variables such as advertising and past sales levels are used as explanatory variables.\n","\n","## Module 7.
